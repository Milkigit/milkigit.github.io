## Bio

I am a tenured assistant professor at [Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam](https://vu.nl/en), also a faculty member of the [VUSec Group](https://www.vusec.net/). I am passionate to make AI systems more reliable. Prior to join VU, I got my Ph.D. from [CISPA Helmholtz Center for Information Security](http://cispa.de/) (Saarbrücken, Germany), supervised by [Prof. Michael Backes](https://cispa.de/people/backes/). I have two year industrial experience of working as an Operating System Engineer at 2012 Labs@Huawei (Hangzhou, China). I got my master's degree from Zhejiang University and bachelor's degree from Lanzhou University.

## Research Interests

- Trustworthy AI: Privacy, Security, Safety, Auditing, and Accountability

- Privacy-Preserving Machine Learning: Synthetic Data Generation, Differential Privacy

- AI for CyberSecurity: AI-Driven Automatic Vulnerability Discovery

## Job Openings

I am always looking for self-motivated students to work with me. If you would like to apply for a position, feel free to send me an [e-mail](mailto:m.chen2@vu.nl) with your CV and fill out this [Form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1gMiWvk_l3UAkY-nj250_UkxGU4IxsVUp5i2iwBnhiSU/edit) to schedule a meeting. If you would like to do your thesis with me, please drop me an email with your CV and transcript.
