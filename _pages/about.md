## Bio

Hello! I am a Ph.D. student at [CISPA Helmholtz Center for Information Security](http://cispa.de/), supervised by [Prof. Dr. Dr. h. c. Michael Backes](https://cispa.de/people/backes/). Prior to joining CISPA, I was an Operating System Engineer at 2012 Labs@Huawei (Hangzhou). I got my master's degree from Zhejiang University (2017) and bachelor's degree from Lanzhou University (2014).
